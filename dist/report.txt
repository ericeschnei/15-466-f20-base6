The %A% %N% is looking very %A% this time of year.
After reviewing the %N%, it is safe to say that the %A% %N% is more %A% than usual.
We are confident that our team can be both %A% and %A%.
Although we didn't hit our projections regarding the %N%, we think that this is because our %N% is very %A%.
If I could describe our %N% in three words, it would be these: %A%, %A%, and %A%.
We exceeded our %A% goals for the %N%, but only because we cut back on the most %A% of our %N%.
I'm constantly approached on the street by people asking about how %A% our %N% is. To be frank--it is very %A%.
When I wake up in the morning, my mother looks me dead in my eyes. She asks me, "Are you going to make your %N% more %A% this year?" Every morning, I tell her the same thing: my %N% are as %A% as the rising sun.
